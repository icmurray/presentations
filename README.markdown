# Landslide Presentations

To build, install the python dependencies listed in `pip-requirements.txt`:

    ```sh
    pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
    ```

Then use `landslide` to build the presentation, eg:

    ```sh
    landslide applicative_functors/slides/slides.markdown
    ```

That's it.
